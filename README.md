# Federated quantum machine learning school project
This project was realised by 4 students of INSA Rennes. 
The aim was to classify 2 digits on the MNIST database, using both federated and quantum neural networks.

This repository contains 4 notebooks :
  - _Classic CNN_ enables to classify digits using classical convolutional neural network
  - _Federated learning_ that implements federated neural networks
